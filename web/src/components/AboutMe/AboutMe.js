      <p>
        I am an extremely hard-working individual. I appreciate everyone and
        strive to help others learn as I am extremely grateful for what I have
        and I like helping others achieve their goals as well.
      </p>
      <p className="my-2">
        I'm also not a big fan of questions like "tell me a time when..." These
        questions imply the idea that I am not constantly going the extra mile,
        or solving problems, or helping others within my team.
      </p>
      <p>I also like building cool ðŸ’©</p>
