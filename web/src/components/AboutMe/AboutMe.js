      <p className="my-2">
        I cannot stand questions like "tell me a time when..." These questions
        imply the idea that I am not constantly going the extra mile, or solving
        problems, or helping others within my team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from this, I am an extremely hard-working individual. I accept all
        types of people and strive to help others learn as I am extremely
        grateful for what I have. I also like building cool ðŸ’©
